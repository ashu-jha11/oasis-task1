In this online reservation system, the basic idea behind this project is to save the data in central database which can be accessed by the authorize person. I have provided 3 modules 
for this project that is:

1. Login Form: To access this online reservation system each user should have a valid login id and password. After providing correct login id and password user can access main system.
2. Reservation System: Under reservation system, there is reservation form where user have to fill necessary details such as train number or train name, class type, day of journey,
   starting place to destination. At last user have to press add reservation button to add the reservation in database.
4. Cancellation Form: If user wants to cancel the booking they can cancel the reservation by providing PNR number and press the cancel reservation button for reservation cancellation.
